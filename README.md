 The Potatoes Dataset consists of 2152 healthy and unhealthy images and it is divided into 3 Classes by species and disease, which are called: 'Potato___Early_blight', 'Potato___Late_blight', 'Potato___healthy'.  It was created with six different augmentation techniques for creating more diverse datasets with different background conditions.  UsingKagglee website, we can find and download this dataset, from the link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjuntejaswi/plant-villag. 
Doing some pre-processing, image processing, and scaling data. Scaling the image into the numpy array that we saw previously was between 0 to 255, which is an RGB scale. Demanding to divide the dataset by 255 so that will get the number between 0 and 1.
Building a lot of layers. Then the activation layer using popular hidden layers is Relu because it is very fast to compute and the input_shape here is 256 by 256. 
After the convolutional layer you generally have a Pooling layer, the Max Pooling layer means a 4 by 4 pixels area, when using this, you are preserving the features and you are reducing the size of the image which can be very helpful computation. So here, we are putting the max pooling layer of size 2D. And Dense layer and the Final layer are the final output of classification. We are going to flatten it, then add a Dense layer that has 64 neurons using activation Relu and adding 3 classes with a softmax activation function.
